description: This resource contains a practice final exam with questions on hydraulic
  analysis of the PWR primary system at cold zero-power conditions, surface tension
  effects in borated water draining from a BWR standby liquid control tank, flow split
  between a heated and an adiabatic channel, and quenching experiments to stimulate
  boiling heat transfer during a LB-LOCA.
