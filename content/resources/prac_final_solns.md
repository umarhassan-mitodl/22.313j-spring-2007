description: This resource contains a practice final exam with solutions to questions
  on hydraulic analysis of the PWR primary system at cold zero-power conditions, surface
  tension effects in borated water draining from a BWR standby liquid control tank,
  flow split between a heated and an adiabatic channel, and quenching experiments
  to stimulate boiling heat transfer during a LB-LOCA.
